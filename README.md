Landing Page - Odin Project

I have been requested by The Odin Project to
create a 'landing page' from scratch using the
knowledge I have gained so far from the course.

I have started this project with good confidence
since I surpassed all of the minor assignments 
to do with Flexbox and the box model.

Edit 05/12/22:

I have completed the project and and very pleased
with the result and I'm happy with the accuracy
i have achieved in the replication. I've also 
learned a few more things on my own from researching
problems I have encountered which has also been a 
benefit of this project.
